description: Hi! My name's Natalie!
---

<p>I'm a senior full-stack developer currently working for a global shopper marketing agency. My stack primarily consists of LAMP systems with Drupal being my CMS of choice.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to play games, shoot my bow, or cuddle my cats 🐱</p>

<p>I also have a design blog: <a href="https://www.divine-designs.net/" target="_blank">Divine Designs</a> - though I definitely consider myself more a developer than a designer.</p>

<p>Please do give me a follow on the social links below 😊</p>
