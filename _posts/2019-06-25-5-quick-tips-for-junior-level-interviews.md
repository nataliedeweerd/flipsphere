title: "5 Quick Tips for Junior Level Interviews"

Below are some things I look out for when interviewing junior developers. It's obviously not a comprehensive list, but hopefully gives you a little insight into what some interviewers are looking for.

For what it's worth, I'm based in the UK. 


## 1. Be honest about what you know.

Don't lie in your interview. If you don't know something, be honest. If you're confident you could learn it quickly, say so, and explain why:

> "I don't know any Javascript frameworks yet, but I have a good understanding of vanilla Javascript code so believe I could pick this up quickly".

By admitting you don't understand something, it adds credibility to everything you've said before.


## 2. Don't be afraid to show your passion.

Tell me about your side projects! If you've made a side-project you're super proud of, but are a bit wary of sharing because it's geeky, tell me anyway! It doesn't matter if I understand the reference, it shows a passion for coding.

If you're passionate I care less about what you know. I can teach you to code, but I can't teach you enthusiasm.


## 3. Ask questions.

**An interview is a 2-way street.** I'm interviewing *you* to see if you're the right candidate for the role just as much as you're interviewing *me and the company* to make sure we're a good fit for you. If you accept the role you'll be spending nearly 8 hours a day inside the company's walls - make sure you're happy with that!

Also ask about the team you'll be joining. How big is it? How supported will you be? Are there frequent social events?


## 4. Ask more questions!

Asking questions also rings true for any "take home" problem you might be given. If you don't understand the problem, ask; just don't ask how for the solution. For example, don't ask: *"How do I order an array?"*, but rather *"Would you like the array ordered by name, or total?"*).

This shows a keenness to understand the problem correctly, and also shows off a little of your knowledge because you know arrays can be ordered in different ways.


## 5. Research the company. 

This is true for any level of interview to be fair, but for God's sake do your research before you go to an interview. I won't be trying to trip you up, or grilling you on what our last product launch was, but I'll know straight away if you haven't even looked at our website.

One thing I like to do if I'm being interviewed is find one cool project the company has done recently and bring it up in my interview.
